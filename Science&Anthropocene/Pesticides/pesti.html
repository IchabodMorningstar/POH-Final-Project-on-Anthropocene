          <p class="header-text">
            The story of pesticides began when DDT saved thousands of lives in
            World War II by killing malaria-carrying mosquitoes as the first
            “organic” chemical insecticide. Since then, with the progress of
            chemical technology, various organic compounds have been used in
            pest control and achieved excellent results. However, are those
            chemical pesticides in the Anthropocene really so perfect?

                global exposure to these chemicals. Traveling through water,
                air, and in migrating animals, pesticides can be found in
                drinking water reservoirs, the atmosphere, on mountain tops, and
                even in remote areas in the Arctic where they are not used.”</a

              This picture shows the process of pesticides reaching other areas
              through water circulation. The pesticide sprayed on the surface of
              plant leaves evaporates into the atmosphere together with the
              water generated by plants and forms clouds. Those polluted clouds
              will reach other areas through wind drift and generate
              precipitation, which pollutes the soil and water resources.

                  The widespread use of pesticides will raise the resistance
                  level in the target insect, making the use unsustainable.
                  Before the application of pesticide A, a small percentage of
                  individuals within a pest population developed pesticide
                  resistance through genetic mutation. After applying pesticide
                  A, most non-resistant individuals were killed, and resistant
                  individuals survived and reproduced, creating a population
                  with a higher proportion of pesticide resistance.

                · Non-specific pesticides can kill non-target insects. When
                non-specific pesticides are applied to kill an insect pest, they
                also kill all the other insects exposed to it. This may include
                useful insects, like bees that are needed to pollinate crops.

                other organisms through the relationship of predation.Currently,

                >After pesticides kill most insects that come into contact with
                them, insect populations will decline significantly. Since most
                insects are primary consumers in the food web, they feed on
                producers and are preyed upon by secondary consumers. Therefore,
                if the number of insects decreases, secondary consumers such as
                rats and frogs will be at risk of food shortages, and their
                populations will also decline. In the same way, the food source
                of tertiary consumers who prey on secondary consumers will be
                affected.

                  The natural enemies of pests can be divided into parasitic and

                  are mainly used to control gathering pests. The main parasitic
                  enemies are various parasitic wasps, and the Fall Webworms’

                  the silkworm pupae hanging on the trees in the picture were
                  infested with the Chouioia cunea Yang, the natural enemy of
                  the moth. According to the staff, in recent years, the park
                  management department released cocoons in late June. Two or
                  three days after the release, the Chouioia cunea Yang will
                  emerge from the cocoon's opening, find the nearby pupa of the
                  fall webworm, lay eggs inside, and kills the moth from within.

                  life habits of pests, directly with simple instruments to
                  kill. For example, use the phototaxis of nocturnal insects to
                  set up light sources for trapping; or take advantage of the
                  pests' food preferences, use food to make bait and kill some
                  specific pests.
