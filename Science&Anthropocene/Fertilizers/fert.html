            With the world's increasing population, agricultural productivity
            development has become necessary. In order to improve productivity,
            mankind has invented a series of scientific and technological means,
            such as fertilizers, to transform the earth.

          The three most essential fertilizers are nitrogen fertilizer,
          phosphorus fertilizer, and potassium fertilizer. Those components in
          them play significant roles in plant growth.

                Farmers closer to agriculture may know more about it, so I
                interviewed my mother, Caixia Li. She was born in 1975 in
                Shuangfeng, Hunan province, China. Her youth age, the 1980s and
                1990s, was a period of rapid development of China's agriculture
                industry. Growing up in the countryside, she witnessed the
                development of China's agriculture, various changes in the use
                of fertilizers, and improvements in people's ideas about
                fertilizers.

          <p class="feature-text">
            She mentions that fertilizer was a rush-to-buy commodity at that
            time: "The rural supply and marketing cooperatives had special sales
            of fertilizer like ammonia, urea, phosphate fertilizer, nitrogen
            fertilizer, etc., which was transported to the supply and marketing
            cooperatives truck by truck." "There was a time when you had to buy
            fertilizer with tickets." She adds. At the same time, she also saw
            the harm of chemical fertilizers: "Sometimes after using chemical
            fertilizers and pesticides, all the loaches in the fields died... In
            just over a decade, the ponds and rivers in the countryside were
            polluted, the water quality was no longer clear, and there were no
            loaches or small fish in the rice fields anymore."

              All over the world, the massive use of fertilizers has had an

                Take nitrogen fertilizer as an example. The above animation
                shows the nitrogen cycle process, in which nitrogen fertilizer
                usually brings its power to provide NH3 and NH4. In the case of
                excessive use, a significant number of NH3 and NH4 will be
                converted into NO2. Emma Bryce, a journalist, says in her
