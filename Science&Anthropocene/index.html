                Science has its dichotomy of benefit and destruction since
                humans utilized it in reality. Most scientists carried the will
                of benefiting the world and invented novel objects. Meanwhile,
                their inventions were taken the advantage of by those who posed
                their ambition over the general good.

                Anthropocene.

              Pesticides were originally used to combat insect vectors for
              disease during World War II. After being adapted for the control
              of insect pests in agriculture, pesticides effectively shrink the
              population of pests and become one of the symbols of agriculture
              in the Anthropocene. However, the heavy use of pesticides has
              allowed them to reach most parts of the Earth through the water
              cycle, which had implicit but severe negative impacts on other
              non-target organisms, including humans, in various ways.

              Fertilizer, a major agricultural invention in the Anthropocene, is
              driving the development of agriculture while changing the
              environment. The fertilizer consumption has increased rapidly in
              decades and has become a significant part of the Great
              Acceleration of the Anthropocene. Fertilizer is often very helpful
              for crop short-term agricultural planting. However, since the
              development of synthetic fertilizers, various nitrogen fertilizer
              have gradually impacted the cycle of these chemical elements in
              the eco-system, and crises arise accordingly.

                The invention of nukes, fertilizers and pesticides were

                  Neon lights and virtual reality are other important features
                  of the future world. They introduce a world where the true are
                  mingled with the false. People can only deceive themselves
                  through hightech to escape this bleak Anthropocene.

                  The origin motion picture soundtrack is composed by
                  progressive Greek musician Vangelis, who employs electronic
                  and synthetic music to introduce the future world. Through the
                  resonant electronic sound, the exotic and hazy dystopian
                  atmosphere is vividly depicted.

                The presentation of the Anthropocene in Blade Runner series is
                abstract and in the position of background. As director Sarah

                The impact of the Anthropocene is so comprehensive and
                significant that it cannot only be presented in climate change,
                or technologies like nukes, fertilizers or pesticides. Instead,
                we should comprehend it as a new geological epoch which
                influences every aspect in our life. Though individuals'
                existence in it may be like “tears in rain”, we should protect
                our planet to avoid the dystopian future in Blade Runner series.
