            Many scientists are proposing a new geological epoch - the
            Anthropocene, but there's no agreement yet as to its beginning. The
            start might be a historical event - the first nuclear explosion in
            1945. This page will focus more on Nuclear Power.

                In 2022, many European countries announce ceasing the use of
                nuclear power plants (NPP). Environmental protection is a
                responsibility on humans' shoulders, but nuclear power are clean
                energy which, if handled properly, is friendly to the
                eco-system. What some so-called environmentalists boycott is
                their fear of nuke, especially after the catastrophe in
                Chernobyl and the irresponsible disposal in Fukushima.

                The locations of NPP demonstrates a focus in industrialized
                countries. Most of NPPs lie in developed countries and few
                locate in developmentally potential countries. These countries
                consume large amount of power and significantly contributed to
                climate change in the past decades. They operate the NPPs since
                nuclear is clean and don't depend on nature, like tide- and
                wind-powered generators. Moreover, fission is a controllable
                power source coming with the Anthropocene, whose power-mass
                ratio is greatly higher than other resources. Therefore as

                Nukes have been buried underground since the formation of the
                Earth. Humans didn't take advantage of them until the
                Anthropocene began. Most significantly, nukes helped end WWⅡ in
                Japanese occupied regions. After that, humans turned to benign
                usage of nukes. Nuclear power is a powerful substitute for
                traditional polluting fuels. Einstein's mass-energy function
                opened a novel gate for nuclear technology development, in US

                The Anthropocene is essentially an era of humans, so the usages
                of nukes are affected by economy, politics, technologies and the

                <a

                In 2011, German major power production utilities faced a
                survival crisis of sudden changes in nuclear power regulation,
                as renewable energy competition intensified, and the economy
                declined. Moreover, nukes are a military strategic resource, the
                world is afraid of improper use as weapons instead of welfare
                providers, hence the popularization of nuclear power globally
                will be hindered by the world's major powers, for instance, NATO
                intervenes with nukes in Iran. On physics level, humans haven't
                acquired enough knowledge of nuclear reactions, thus our
                exploitation of nukes is just like the ancients playing with
                fire.

                Nukes were almost irrelevant to humans until the Anthropocene
                began. Nukes are so powerful that humans cannot fully control.
                Powerful things tend to be a double-edged blade, and so are
                nukes. With nuclear reaction, Anthropocene cities can be wiped
                out in seconds, while potential space transportation can travel
                kilometers in seconds. The impacts of nukes on the Anthropocene
                are evident, as they mark the beginning and illuminate the
                future. The nuclear power shown on this page is a great aspect
                of nukes in the Anthropocene. It brought catastrophes in
                Hiroshima and Chernobyl, yet humans can still count on it to
                ease the environmental pollutions. We, humans, should take the
                positive advantages of nukes and proceed into the Anthropocene
                with the benefits nukes offer to us.
